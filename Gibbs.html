<p> They picked me out of a pile of puppies, a tangled, rolling mass of paws and ears and cuteness, behind a small house near a town in the southern side of Chicago called Oak Lawn. I don’t remember much about where I was born, but I do remember my mother. It seemed that she didn’t really like us; she seemed relieved whenever one of us left. I never knew my father and my owners haven't either. The breeders told my parents that the father hasn’t around but he was one hundred percent pug, but I don’t believe them.</p>

<p>I remember the warmth on the afternoon I left for my new home. My littermates and I were tussling around like we always did, and a hand reached into the pile and suddenly I was dangling high in the air 
“This one” a man said. 
“ we were thinking about keeping him” the breeder said. He always said this to get more money. 
“ will you let him go?” my potential owners said,
“ Fur a price” the breeder said.

 <p> I am a goofy six year old bulldog/pug Mix but I still remain the alpha dog of the house. I am turning six years old soon so i am slowly but surley getting a tad bit grumpier & older but I can still act like a puppy when wild up. In todays time, I enjoy living a more relaxed and low-key style of life now. </p>
