<p> Hello guys! my name is Danielle but everyone calls me Dani for short. I am one goofy but extremely loving dog. If i dont recognize you within 10 seconds, my bark could be heard blocks away but as soon as you give me a scratch on the back, I will immediately become your best friend. I am3 year old German Shepard that is about to turn 4 years old on April 19th, 2018. I was born into a great loving family with a firefighter as an owner who raised me until i was 6 months old. With a newborn baby on the way in addition to a paranoid girlfriend, My owner was forced to put me up for adoption. Before my owner did anything drastic regarding animal shelters, he put up a facebook Ad for our local town community and i was immediately transported into a new and improved home. My new owners picked me up that day that AD was posted, talk about lucky eh? At first I didn't know how to reacted but with unconditional love with the other furry friends there, I quickly adjusted to this great new lifestyle. Although I miss my old owner a lot, My new owners provided me a life that I knew my previous owner couldn't afford. </p>
